# Huffman-Encoding-Json

### This method is built to compress the content of JSON files. Base on the Huffman encoding method but has a few differences. 

Content of JSON file:

```json
{
    "ID": "ID1234",
    "NAME": "name",
    "NUMBER": 21.200049152125832
}

```

The JSON file contains information in the form of a string of characters, after reading the data from the file, extract the different characters that appear inside the file into a string . This string is called the string key.

String key:

```json
"gHE5AN6xao1I8.sBywL03(C7]Mh{Un:uTi9l2GDp S4PceR}[YO,)'tm6"
```
